Recommendations for Further Development

    Databases: Consider integrating with databases like PostgreSQL or MongoDB for persistent storage. Libraries like SQLAlchemy or Tortoise-ORM can be used.
    Authentication: Implement JWT-based authentication for secure access.
    Testing: Integrate with pytest for unit testing and httpx for testing FastAPI endpoints.
    Documentation: FastAPI provides automatic documentation with Swagger UI and ReDoc. Ensure they are set up correctly.
    CORS: If the frontend is hosted on a different domain, consider setting up CORS middleware.
